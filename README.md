# CasWrite - Text Editor with Table Support

A powerful text-based editor built with [Casciian](https://github.com/crramirez/casciian) that combines traditional text editing with spreadsheet capabilities. CasWrite supports multiple overlapping windows, mouse operations, and can open both text files and CSV/table files simultaneously.

## Features

- **Text Editing**: Open and edit text files in dedicated editor windows with full editing capabilities
- **Table Support**: Open CSV and TSV files in spreadsheet-like table windows
- **Multiple Windows**: Work with multiple files simultaneously in overlapping windows
- **Rich Menus**:
  - **File Menu**: New, Open, Open as Table, Save, Save As, Exit
  - **Edit Menu**: Undo, Redo, Cut, Copy, Paste, Clear, Find, Replace, Go to Line
  - **System Menu**: Shell access for running OS commands
  - **Window Menu**: Tile, Cascade, Close All, Next, Previous window management
  - **Table Menu**: Table-specific operations for CSV/spreadsheet files
- **Mouse Support**: Full mouse support for window management and text selection
- **Terminal-Based**: Runs in any Xterm-compatible terminal

## Use Cases

CasWrite can serve as:
- A default text editor for Linux (similar to nano or vim but with GUI-like features)
- A CSV/table data viewer and editor
- A multi-file text editing environment
- A combination text and data editor in a single application

## Prerequisites

- Java 21 or later
- Gradle 9.2.1 or later (included via wrapper)
- For native image compilation: GraalVM Java 25 with native-image
- For packaging: fpm (installed via `gem install fpm`)

## Building

### Standard JAR Build

```bash
./gradlew clean build
```

This creates a JAR file in `build/libs/caswrite-<version>.jar`

## Running CasWrite

After building, you can run CasWrite in several ways:

### Run with Gradle

```bash
./gradlew installDist
./build/install/caswrite/bin/caswrite
```

### Run with a file

```bash
# Open a text file
./build/install/caswrite/bin/caswrite myfile.txt

# Open a CSV file (automatically opens in table view)
./build/install/caswrite/bin/caswrite data.csv
```

### Run the JAR directly

```bash
java -jar build/libs/caswrite-<version>.jar
java -jar build/libs/caswrite-<version>.jar myfile.txt
```

### Native Image Compilation (Required for Packaging)

The DEB and RPM packages require a native binary. You need GraalVM Java 25 with native-image installed.

#### Installing GraalVM

You can install GraalVM using SDKMAN:

```bash
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
sdk install java 25.0.0.r25-graalce
```

Or download directly from [GraalVM Downloads](https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/).

#### Building Native Binary

1. Ensure GraalVM Java 25 is installed and configured
2. Run:

```bash
./gradlew nativeCompile
```

This creates a native executable at `build/native/nativeCompile/caswrite`

### Creating DEB and RPM Packages

**Important:** The packages require a native binary. You must first compile the native binary using GraalVM (see above).

#### Prerequisites for Packaging

```bash
# Install fpm and dependencies
sudo apt-get install ruby ruby-dev build-essential rpm
sudo gem install fpm
```

#### Building Packages

After compiling the native binary, build both DEB and RPM packages:

```bash
./gradlew buildPackages
```

Or build individually:

```bash
./gradlew buildDeb    # Creates DEB package in build/distributions/deb/
./gradlew buildRpm    # Creates RPM package in build/distributions/rpm/
```

The packages will include only:
- `/usr/bin/caswrite` - Native executable binary

#### Installing the Packages

**Debian/Ubuntu:**
```bash
sudo dpkg -i build/distributions/deb/caswrite_0.1.0-1_amd64.deb
sudo apt-get install -f  # Install dependencies if needed
```

**RedHat/CentOS/Fedora:**
```bash
sudo rpm -ivh build/distributions/rpm/caswrite-0.1.0-1.x86_64.rpm
```

After installation, you can run the application:
```bash
caswrite
caswrite myfile.txt
caswrite data.csv
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts

CasWrite supports standard keyboard shortcuts:

- **Alt+F**: File menu
- **Alt+E**: Edit menu  
- **Alt+S**: System menu
- **Alt+W**: Window menu
- **Alt+T**: Table menu
- **F3**: Find
- **Ctrl+S**: Save (in editor windows)
- **Ctrl+Q**: Quit
- **Ctrl+X**: Cut
- **Ctrl+C**: Copy
- **Ctrl+V**: Paste

## Customizing the Template

This template is designed to be a starting point for your own Casciian-based application:

1. **Modify features**: Update `CasWrite.java` to add new menu items or functionality
2. **Add file type support**: Extend the file opening logic to support additional formats
3. **Customize menus**: Add new menus or modify existing menu items
4. **Update metadata**: 
   - Edit `build.gradle` to update group, description, URLs, and maintainer information
   - Update `gradle.properties` to set your version
5. **Update documentation**: Modify this README to describe your specific application
